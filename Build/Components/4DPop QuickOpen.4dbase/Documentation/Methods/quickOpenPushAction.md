## Description
The `quickOpenPushAction` method allows you to record your own actions.

## Syntax

`quickOpenEventHandler(Object)`

## Usage

Actions can be code that will be executed or a form that will be displayed on the screen.

### 1] Code actions

The code to execute is defined by a **Formula** defined in the "[formula](#formula)" property.
<br/>It can be a simple line of encapsulated code,

```4d
$o:=New object
$o.name:="Test formula"
$o.formula:=Formula(ALERT("hello world"))
quickOpenPushAction($o)
```
or a project method call.
 
```4d
$o:=New object
$o.name:="Test formula"
$o.formula:=Formula(myMethod)
quickOpenPushAction($o)
```
> ðŸ“Œ Unless you set a "[modal](#modal)" property to true, the code is executed in a new process and provides a default menu bar (with the `Edit` menu).

### 2] Form actions

The component automatically manages the display of a form that you have defined.
<br/>You give the name of the folder containing the form definition in the "[form](#form)" property.

```4d
$o:=New object
$o.name:="test form"
$o.form:="TEST"
quickOpenPushAction($o)
```
> ðŸ“Œ The form is displayed in a new process and provides a default menu bar (with the `Edit` menu).

## Action Object Properties

### â€¢ name
Is the name of the action as it will be displayed in the list. All words are used for the search.
	
#### â€¢ shortcut
This optional property contains additional keywords, other than those in the name, to be used in the search. For example, for the action "Maintenance and Security Center", the shortcut "`msc`" allows typing "msc" to select this action. You can put several words in a row: ie. "FolderDossier"
	
### â€¢ <a name="formula">formula</a>
The formula to be executed. 
	
> ðŸ“Œ If the formula calls one of your methods, there is no need to share this method since the formula is called in the context where it was created.
	
### â€¢ <a name="form">form</a>
The name of a folder containing the form definition to be displayed. This folder must be in a folder named `quickAction` located in the `Resources` folder of the database.
	
> ðŸ“Œ If both `formula` and `form` are defined, `form` will be ignored
	
### â€¢ condition
This optional property allows to provide a formula that will be evaluated to propose or not an action. 
<br/>The formula must return a boolean. ie. the formula `Formula(Application type=4D Remote mode)` will not display the action in a database executed in local mode.

### â€¢ icon
Optional. Allows you to provide a custom icon to use in the list.
	
### â€¢ <a name="modal">modal</a>
By default the code is executed in a new process. If the optional property `modal`is True, the code will be executed into the design process.
